This Project can be used for running analytics on the crypto currency and AUD pair.

This script will generate a file for each currency/ AUD pair for each day one file will be created for every day with every second information logged into the file for a particular pair.

Ideally this script should be associated as a job with Azure or AWS for maximum efficiency. I have used Azure, please fell free to add additional changes if required.
